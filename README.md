# About this script
The script is designed to remove Snap packages and the Snapd service from an Ubuntu system and replace it with Firefox from Mozilla's APT repository. It first prompts the user for confirmation before removing Snap packages and the Snapd service, including stopping and disabling the Snapd service, purging the Snapd package, and deleting Snap-related directories. After Snap is removed, it creates a preference file to prevent Snapd from being reinstalled. The script then prompts the user again to confirm if they want to install Firefox, adds Mozillaâ€™s APT repository, and installs Firefox. Lastly, it optionally installs the Gnome App Store if the user agrees. The script includes error handling to ensure each step completes successfully and provides feedback if something goes wrong.
